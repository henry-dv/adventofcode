### C# solutions to the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) puzzles from 2020 and 2021

----------

## Usage (Linux/Windows/macOS)

Prerequisites: installation of .NET 5.0 (or higher)

Usage (from main directory):
```
> dotnet build
> dotnet run YEAR DAY {1|2} [input_file]
```


If you're on windows, you can also just clone this into Visual Studio and specify the command line arguments there.

----------

By default, the program reads from `/[year]/[day]/input.txt`. You can specify your own puzzle input by adding a file in the corresponding directory and referencing it as a command line argument.
